# &lt;little-planet&gt;

This project is a [Custom HTML Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) (AKA [Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)) that renders an interactive view of a panoramic photo. Can be used with no JavaScript knowledge: just include the component and continue with plain HTML.
